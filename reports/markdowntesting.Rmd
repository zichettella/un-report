##Trial and Error
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#note that the code blocs are grey
```{r}
2 + 2
```

#to name it:
```{r simple_addition}
2 + 2
```

#to exclude it:
```{r simple_addition2, include=FALSE}
2 + 2
```

#to see the result but not include it:
```{r simple_addition3, echo = FALSE}
2 + 2
```
#didn't work tho

```{r simple_addition4, echo = FALSE}
four <- 2 + 2
```
#set inline code with a singel backtick

Did you know that in R, the sum of 2 and 2 is `r four`. This is an example of inline code!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
